# Week-1
This project focuses on classifying plastic waste into categories using CNN. In Week 1, data visualization was performed with a pie chart showing Organic (green) and Recyclable (red) waste proportions. The chart features an explode effect, shadow, and percentage labels for clarity, aiding in dataset analysis for the project.
The dataset for the project is taken from Kaggle. The link is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data
