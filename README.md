# Week-1
This project focuses on classifying plastic waste into categories using CNN. In Week 1, data visualization was performed with a pie chart showing Organic (green) and Recyclable (red) waste proportions. The chart features an explode effect, shadow, and percentage labels for clarity, aiding in dataset analysis for the project.For the visualization task, I used libraries like OpenCV for image reading and preprocessing, Pandas for organizing data, Matplotlib for plotting insights, and TQDM for tracking processing progress. Images were resized to uniform dimensions, normalized for better model compatibility, and labeled dynamically for efficient data preparation. The project was developed and executed in VS Code, ensuring a streamlined workflow.
The dataset for the project is taken from Kaggle. The link is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data
