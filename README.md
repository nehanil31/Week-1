# Week-1
This project focuses on classifying plastic waste into categories using CNN. In Week 1, data visualization was performed with a pie chart showing Organic (green) and Recyclable (red) waste proportions. The chart features an explode effect, shadow, and percentage labels for clarity, aiding in dataset analysis for the project.
